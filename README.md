A graphical user interface for MeshCore mesh network devices via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for on your desktop.

## Why This Project Exists

MeshCore devices like the SenseCAP T1000-E can be managed through two interfaces: USB serial and BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). The official companion apps communicate with devices over BLE, but they are mobile-only. If you want to manage your MeshCore device from a desktop or laptop, the usual approach is to **flash USB-serial firmware** via the web flasher. However, this replaces the BLE Companion firmware, which means you can no longer use the device with mobile companion apps (Android/iOS).

This project provides a **native desktop GUI** that connects to your MeshCore device over BLE — no firmware changes required. Your device stays on BLE Companion firmware and remains fully compatible with the mobile apps. The application is written in Python using cross-platform libraries and runs on **Linux, macOS and Windows**.

> **Note:** This application has only been tested on Linux (Ubuntu 24.04). macOS and Windows should work since all dependencies (`bleak`, `nicegui`, `meshcore`) are cross-platform, but this has not been verified. Feedback and contributions for other platforms are welcome.

Under the hood it uses `bleak` for Bluetooth Low Energy (which talks to BlueZ on Linux, CoreBluetooth on macOS, and WinRT on Windows), `meshcore` as the protocol layer, `meshcoredecoder` for raw LoRa packet decryption and route extraction, and `NiceGUI` for the web-based interface.

> **Linux users:** BLE on Linux can be temperamental. BlueZ occasionally gets into a bad state, especially after repeated connect/disconnect cycles. If you run into connection issues, see the [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md). On macOS and Windows, BLE is generally more stable out of the box.


## Features

- **Real-time Dashboard** — Device info, contacts, messages and RX log
- **Interactive Map** — Leaflet map with markers for own position and contacts
- **Channel Messages** — Send and receive messages on channels
- **Direct Messages** — Click on a contact to send a DM
- **Contact Maintenance** — Pin/unpin contacts to protect them from deletion, bulk-delete unpinned contacts from the device, and toggle automatic contact addition from mesh adverts
- **Message Filtering** — Filter messages per channel via checkboxes
- **Message Route Visualization** — Click any message to open a detailed route page showing the path (hops) through the mesh network on an interactive map, with a hop summary, route table and reply panel
- **Message Archive** — All messages and RX log entries are persisted to disk with configurable retention. Browse archived messages via the archive viewer with filters (channel, time range, text search), pagination and inline route tables
<!-- ADDED: Message Archive feature was missing from features list -->
- **Keyword Bot** — Built-in auto-reply bot that responds to configurable keywords on selected channels, with cooldown and loop prevention
- **Packet Decoding** — Raw LoRa packets from RX log are decoded and decrypted using channel keys, providing message hashes, path hashes and hop data
- **Message Deduplication** — Dual-strategy dedup (hash-based and content-based) prevents duplicate messages from appearing
- **Local Cache** — Device info, contacts and channel keys are cached to disk (`~/.meshcore-gui/cache/`) so the GUI is instantly populated on startup from the last known state, even before BLE connects. Contacts from the device are merged with cached contacts so offline nodes are preserved. Channel keys that fail to load at startup are retried in the background every 30 seconds
- **Periodic Contact Refresh** — Contacts are automatically refreshed from the device at a configurable interval (default: 5 minutes) and merged with the cache
- **Threaded Architecture** — BLE communication in separate thread for stable UI

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Bluetooth Low Energy compatible adapter (built-in or USB)
- MeshCore device with BLE Companion firmware

### Platform support

| Platform | BLE Backend | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) | BlueZ/D-Bus | ✅ Tested |
| macOS | CoreBluetooth | ⬜ Untested |
| Windows 10/11 | WinRT | ⬜ Untested |

## Installation

### 1. System dependencies

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv bluetooth bluez
```

**macOS:**
```bash
# Python 3.10+ via Homebrew (if not already installed)
brew install python
```
No additional Bluetooth packages needed — macOS has CoreBluetooth built in.

**Windows:**
- Install [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (check "Add to PATH" during installation)
- No additional Bluetooth packages needed — Windows 10/11 has WinRT built in.

### 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pe1hvh/meshcore-gui.git
cd meshcore-gui
```

### 3. Create virtual environment

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install Python packages

```bash
pip install nicegui meshcore bleak meshcoredecoder
```

## Usage

### 1. Activate the virtual environment

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
cd meshcore-gui
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
cd meshcore-gui
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Find your BLE device address

**Linux:**
```bash
bluetoothctl scan on
```
Look for your MeshCore device and note the MAC address (e.g., `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`).

**macOS / Windows:**
```bash
python -c "
import asyncio
from bleak import BleakScanner
async def scan():
    devices = await BleakScanner.discover(5.0)
    for d in devices:
        if 'MeshCore' in (d.name or ''):
            print(f'{d.address}  {d.name}')
asyncio.run(scan())
"
```
On macOS the address will be a UUID (e.g., `12345678-ABCD-...`) rather than a MAC address.

### 3. Configure channels

Open `meshcore_gui/config.py` and adjust `CHANNELS_CONFIG` to your own channels:

```python
CHANNELS_CONFIG = [
    {'idx': 0, 'name': 'Public'},
    {'idx': 1, 'name': '#test'},
    {'idx': 2, 'name': 'MyChannel'},
    {'idx': 3, 'name': '#local'},
]
```

**Tip:** Use `meshcli` to determine your channels:

```bash
meshcli -d AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
> get_channel 0
> get_channel 1
# etc.
```

### 4. Start the GUI

```bash
python meshcore_gui.py AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
```

Replace `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF` with the MAC address of your device.

For verbose debug logging:

```bash
python meshcore_gui.py AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF --debug-on
```

### 5. Open the interface

The GUI opens automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:8080`

## Configuration

## Functionality

### Device Info
- Name, frequency, SF/BW, TX power, location, firmware version

### Contacts
- List of known nodes with type and location
- Click on a contact to send a DM
- **Pin/Unpin**: Checkbox per contact to pin it — pinned contacts are sorted to the top and visually marked with a yellow background. Pin state is persisted locally and survives app restart.
- **Bulk delete**: "🧹 Clean up" button removes all unpinned contacts from the device in one action, with a confirmation dialog showing how many will be removed vs. kept.
- **Auto-add toggle**: "📥 Auto-add" checkbox controls whether the device automatically adds new contacts when it receives adverts from other mesh nodes. Disabled by default to prevent the contact list from filling up.

### Map
- OpenStreetMap with markers for own position and contacts
- Shows your own position (blue marker)
- Automatically centers on your own position

### Channel Messages
- Select a channel in the dropdown
- Type your message and click "Send"
- Received messages appear in the messages list
- Filter messages via the checkboxes

### Direct Messages (DM)
- Click on a contact in the contacts list
- A dialog opens where you can type your message
- Click "Send" to send the DM

### Message Route Visualization

Click on any message in the messages list to open a route page in a new tab. The route page shows:

- **Hop summary** — Number of hops and SNR
- **Interactive map** — Leaflet map with markers for sender, repeaters and receiver, connected by a polyline showing the message path
- **Route table** — Detailed table with each hop: name, ID (first byte of public key), node type and GPS coordinates
- **Reply panel** — Pre-filled reply message with route acknowledgement (sender, path length, repeater IDs)

Route data is resolved from two sources (in priority order):
1. **RX log packet decode** — Path hashes extracted from the raw LoRa packet via `meshcoredecoder`
2. **Contact out_path** — Stored route from the sender's contact record (fallback)

<!-- ADDED: Message Archive section was missing from Functionality -->
### Message Archive

All incoming messages and RX log entries are automatically persisted to disk in `~/.meshcore-gui/archive/`. One JSON file per data type per BLE device address.

Click the **📚 Archive** button in the Messages panel header to open the archive viewer in a new tab. The archive viewer provides:

- **Pagination** — 50 messages per page, with Previous/Next navigation
- **Channel filter** — Filter by specific channel or view all
- **Time range filter** — Last 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or all time
- **Text search** — Case-insensitive search in message text
- **Inline route tables** — Expandable route display per message (sender, repeaters, receiver with names and IDs)
- **Reply from archive** — Expandable reply panel per message with pre-filled @sender mention

Old data is automatically cleaned up based on configurable retention periods (`MESSAGE_RETENTION_DAYS`, `RXLOG_RETENTION_DAYS` in `config.py`).

### Local Cache

Device info, contacts and channel keys are automatically cached to disk in `~/.meshcore-gui/cache/`. One JSON file is created per BLE device address.

**Startup behaviour:**
1. Cache is loaded first — GUI is immediately populated with the last known state
2. BLE connection is established in the background
3. Fresh data from the device updates both the GUI and the cache

**Channel key loading:**

BLE commands to the MeshCore device are fundamentally unreliable — `get_channel()`, `send_appstart()` and `send_device_query()` can all fail even after multiple retries. The channel key loading strategy handles this gracefully:

1. Cached keys are loaded first and never overwritten by name-derived fallbacks
2. Each channel gets 2 quick attempts at startup (non-blocking)
3. Channels that fail are retried in the background every 30 seconds
4. Successfully loaded keys are immediately written to the cache for next startup

**Contact merge strategy:**
- New contacts from the device are added to the cache with a `last_seen` timestamp
- Existing contacts are updated (fresh data wins)
- Contacts only in cache (node offline) are preserved

If BLE connection fails, the GUI remains usable with cached data and shows an offline status.

### Keyword Bot

The built-in bot automatically replies to messages containing recognised keywords. Enable or disable it via the 🤖 BOT checkbox in the filter bar.

<!-- CHANGED: Bot device name switching feature added in v5.5.0 -->
**Device name switching:** When the BOT checkbox is enabled, the device name is automatically changed to the configured `BOT_DEVICE_NAME` (default: `;NL-OV-ZWL-STDSHGN-WKC Bot`). The original device name is saved and restored when bot mode is disabled. This allows the mesh network to identify the node as a bot by its name.

**Default keywords:**

<!-- CHANGED: Removed "Zwolle Bot:" prefix from example replies — bot replies no longer include a name prefix (v5.5.0) -->

| Keyword | Reply |
|---------|-------|
| `test` | `<sender>, rcvd \| SNR <snr> \| path(<hops>); <repeaters>` |
| `ping` | `Pong!` |
| `help` | `test, ping, help` |

**Safety guards:**
- Only replies on configured channels (`BOT_CHANNELS`)
- Ignores own messages and messages from other bots (names ending in "Bot")
- Cooldown period between replies (default: 5 seconds)

**Customisation:** Edit `BOT_KEYWORDS` in `meshcore_gui/services/bot.py`. Templates support `{sender}`, `{snr}` and `{path}` variables.

### RX Log
- Received packets with SNR and type

### Actions
- Refresh data
- Send advertisement

## Architecture

<!-- CHANGED: Architecture diagram updated — added MessageArchive component -->

- **BLEWorker**: Runs in separate thread with its own asyncio loop, with background retry for missing channel keys
- **CommandHandler**: Executes commands (send message, advert, refresh, purge unpinned, set auto-add, set bot name, restore name)
<!-- CHANGED: Added set bot name and restore name commands (v5.5.0) -->
- **EventHandler**: Processes incoming BLE events (messages, RX log)
- **PacketDecoder**: Decodes raw LoRa packets and extracts route data
- **MeshBot**: Keyword-triggered auto-reply on configured channels with automatic device name switching
<!-- CHANGED: Added device name switching to MeshBot description (v5.5.0) -->
- **DualDeduplicator**: Prevents duplicate messages (hash-based + content-based)
- **DeviceCache**: Local JSON cache per device for instant startup and offline resilience
- **MessageArchive**: Persistent storage for messages and RX log with configurable retention and automatic cleanup
<!-- ADDED: MessageArchive component description -->
- **PinStore**: Persistent pin state storage per device (JSON-backed)
- **ContactCleanerService**: Bulk-delete logic for unpinned contacts with statistics
- **SharedData**: Thread-safe data sharing between BLE and GUI via Protocol interfaces
- **DashboardPage**: Main GUI with modular panels (device, contacts, map, messages, etc.)
- **RoutePage**: Standalone route visualization page opened per message
- **ArchivePage**: Archive viewer with filters, pagination and inline route tables
<!-- ADDED: ArchivePage component description -->
- **Communication**: Via command queue (GUI→BLE) and shared state with flags (BLE→GUI)

## Known Limitations

1. **Channels hardcoded** — The `get_channel()` function in meshcore-py is unreliable via BLE (mitigated by background retry and disk caching of channel keys)
2. **BLE command unreliability** — `send_appstart()`, `send_device_query()` and `get_channel()` can all fail intermittently. The application uses aggressive retries (10 attempts for device info, background retry every 30s for channel keys) and disk caching to compensate
3. **Initial load time** — GUI waits for BLE data before the first render is complete (mitigated by cache: if cached data exists, the GUI populates instantly)
4. **Archive route visualization** — Route data for archived messages depends on contacts currently in memory; archived-only messages without recent contact data may show incomplete routes
<!-- ADDED: Archive-related limitation -->

## Troubleshooting

### Linux

For comprehensive Linux BLE troubleshooting (including the `EOFError` / `start_notify` issue), see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

#### Quick fixes

##### GUI remains empty / BLE connection fails

1. First disconnect any existing BLE connections:
   ```bash
   bluetoothctl disconnect AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
   ```
2. Wait 2 seconds:
   ```bash
   sleep 2
   ```
3. Restart the GUI:
   ```bash
   python meshcore_gui.py AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
   ```

##### Bluetooth permissions

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G bluetooth $USER
# Log out and back in
```

### macOS

- Make sure Bluetooth is enabled in System Settings
- Grant your terminal app Bluetooth access when prompted
- Use the UUID address from BleakScanner, not a MAC address

### Windows

- Make sure Bluetooth is enabled in Settings → Bluetooth & devices
- Run the terminal as a regular user (not as Administrator — WinRT BLE can behave unexpectedly with elevated privileges)

### All platforms

#### Device not found

Make sure the MeshCore device is powered on and in BLE Companion mode. Run the BleakScanner script from the Usage section to verify it is visible.

#### Messages not arriving

- Check if your channels are correctly configured
- Use `meshcli` to verify that messages are arriving

#### Clearing the cache

If cached data causes issues (e.g. stale contacts), delete the cache file:

```bash
rm ~/.meshcore-gui/cache/*.json
```

The cache will be recreated on the next successful BLE connection.

## Development

### Debug mode

Enable via command line flag:

```bash
python meshcore_gui.py AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF --debug-on
```

Or set `DEBUG = True` in `meshcore_gui/config.py`.

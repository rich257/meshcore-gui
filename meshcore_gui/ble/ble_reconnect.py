"""
Automatic BLE reconnect with bond cleanup via D-Bus.

Replaces manual ``bluetoothctl remove`` steps.  Provides two
functions:

- :func:`remove_bond` — removes a BLE bond via D-Bus
  (equivalent of ``bluetoothctl remove <address>``)
- :func:`reconnect_loop` — exponential backoff reconnect with
  automatic bond cleanup

Both functions are async and can be called directly in the
BLEWorker's asyncio event loop.
